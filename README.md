# SPOTIFY MUSIC PREFERENCE DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT
### Project Objective
In this project, I analyzed a Spotify dataset with 520 entries to uncover interesting insights into how people listen to music. The goal was to explore user preferences and behavior around music consumption.  
The analysis explores key aspects of music consumption, including:
1. **Gender Preferences**: How music listening habits differ between genders.  
2. **Most Preferred Listening Time**: The times of day people are most likely to enjoy their favorite tunes.  
3. **Favorite Genre**: The music genres users love the most.  
4. **Listening Frequency**: How often people come back to listen.  
5. **Preferred Content**: Whether users prefer playlists, albums, or singles.  

I also took a closer look at how factors like age influence listening habits and how users rate the quality of music recordings.  

This analysis provides a clear picture of how people interact with music on Spotify, shedding light on their preferences, habits, and how demographics play a role in shaping their choices.

## Data Transformation
This data set was cleaned and transformed using Power BI. The data set contained 20 columns and 
520 rows (post cleaning). There were no blanks and duplicate in the data set and I only worked with 
the columns I needed to support my hypothesis.
The data transformation was executed using Power Query, a robust tool for data preparation.
Values within the dataset were systematically replaced and refined, ensuring data accuracy and 
consistency.

## Data analysis tool and visualization
The tool used for this data analysis and visualization is Power BI.
## Statement of problem
This analysis aim to uncover insight and to address the following questions as I look into the world 
of Spotify user generated data.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of the Spotify music streaming dataset has provided valuable insights 
into user behavior and preferences on the platform. It is evident that Spotify attracts a diverse user 
base, with a higher percentage of female users, particularly favoring genres like 'melody,' classical, 
and pop. Users predominantly engage with the platform during nighttime hours, showcasing an 
opportunity for targeted promotions and content curation during this period. Music listening during 
travel emerged as a popular context, suggesting the importance of optimizing the mobile app for an 
enhanced on-the-go experience. While there are clear trends in user behavior, the platform should 
also strive to diversify content and explore ways to engage users during social gatherings. These 
findings underscore the significance of data-driven decision-making and ongoing user engagement 
strategies to ensure Spotify's continued success in the dynamic music streaming industry.
