# SPOTIFY MUSIC PREFERENCE DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT
### Project Objective
In this project, I analyzed a Spotify dataset with 520 entries to uncover interesting insights into how people listen to music. The goal was to explore user preferences and behavior around music consumption.  
The analysis explores key aspects of music consumption, including:
1. **Gender Preferences**: How music listening habits differ between genders.  
2. **Most Preferred Listening Time**: The times of day people are most likely to enjoy their favorite tunes.  
3. **Favorite Genre**: The music genres users love the most.  
4. **Listening Frequency**: How often people come back to listen.  
5. **Preferred Content**: Whether users prefer playlists, albums, or singles.  

I also took a closer look at how factors like age influence listening habits and how users rate the quality of music recordings.  

This analysis provides a clear picture of how people interact with music on Spotify, shedding light on their preferences, habits, and how demographics play a role in shaping their choices.

## Data Transformation
This data set was cleaned and transformed using Power BI. The data set contained 20 columns and 
520 rows (post cleaning). There were no blanks and duplicate in the data set and I only worked with 
the columns I needed to support my hypothesis.
The data transformation was executed using Power Query, a robust tool for data preparation.
Values within the dataset were systematically replaced and refined, ensuring data accuracy and 
consistency.

## Data analysis tool and visualization
The tool used for this data analysis and visualization is Power BI.
